# HOW TO START MULTIPLAYER 

1) Open up LanGame.py and LanGame1.py

2) In the class Network innit method change the self.host to whatever your IPv4 address is. In case you don't know how to fetch that, do the following:
              
             1) Open up cmd 
             2) Type ipconfig 
             3) Find IPv4 address
3) Do it for both LanGame.py and LanGame1.py

4) Run Server.py first, then run LanGame.py and LanGame1.py.
